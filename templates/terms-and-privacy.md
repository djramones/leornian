{{ service_name }} is a Service, accessible at `{{ service_url }}`, for saving, sharing, and viewing notes (short pieces of text data).

This Service is provided free of charge.

## Acceptance of Terms

By accessing and using this Service, and when signing up for an account, you acknowledge and accept these Terms of Service, including the Privacy Policy, and declare that you are at least 18 years of age. These Terms are an agreement between you and the operator(s) of {{ service_name }}.

## User Account

You may sign up for a user account to be able to access certain features and functionalities of the Service.

To create an account, you are required to provide a username of your choosing, and a valid, working email address.

Your username must not be of an objectionable nature; objectionable usernames include, but are not limited to, names that infringe on trademarks, or those that attempt to maliciously impersonate persons or entities. {{ service_name }} reserves the right, but not the obligation, to determine if a username is objectionable, and take appropriate actions, including but not limited to deactivating or deleting the associated account.

You understand that whoever has access to the email address you provide can also obtain access to your {{ service_name }} account, as the email address is used for account recovery functionality.

## User Content and Creative Commons Licensing

You are responsible for any content that you submit or provide to the Service, including its legality or appropriateness, or, if relevant, its accuracy.

By submitting content to the Service, you also agree to license such content to both the Service and other users of the Service, under the terms of the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) (CC BY 4.0).

It is your responsibility to read and understand this license and to consider its implications, which includes but are not limited to:

- The requirement that you have the right, in the first place, to submit and license such content under CC BY 4.0.
- The possibility that the content you have submitted may be retained by the Service, without attribution, in the event of termination of your user account.

You agree, in relation to the Creative Commons license conditions (Section 3a), that your account username in combination with a content ‘permalink’ assigned by the Service (if available), suffices for attribution of the content that you submit.

## Allowed Content and Acceptable Use

You may not submit content that is generally objectionable. This includes, but is not limited to, content that is unlawful, infringing of the rights of others, defamatory, hateful, harassing, abusive, violent, or dangerous.

Certain content that could be considered objectionable, but not universally so, *may* be allowed by the Service; this includes content of a commercial, political, religious, or sexual nature, overtly or not. When submitting such content, users may opt, but are not required to, use Service functionality that allows to obscure or render less visible or discoverable the submitted content; if this functionality is available, it might be known by the term *unlisting* or another similar name.

You may not access or use the Service in a manner that will excessively strain or consume its hardware or communications resources.

{{ service_name }} reserves the right, but not the obligation, to unilaterally restrict access to, or remove, contents and accounts deemed in violation of these Terms, and to determine whether such a violation has occurred.

As {{ service_name }} cannot control all activities by users on the Service, you agree to use the Service at your own risk, and that you may be exposed to content that you may find objectionable, and that {{ service_name }} is not liable for any damages resulting from such incidents.

## Availability, Integrity, and Backups of the Service and User Content & Data

{{ service_name }} aims to maintain, but does not guarantee, the availability or integrity of the Service and its user content or data.

You are responsible for maintaining copies (backups) of your own content or account data independent of the Service, if you desire or require such. {{ service_name }} may provide functionality to assist with this, but does not guarantee or claim any level of reliability, completeness, or appropriateness of any such functionality.

## Termination

{{ service_name }} reserves the right to deactivate (i.e., prevent access to) or delete your account at any time for any reason whatsoever, but especially due to violations of these Terms, including the guidelines under Allowed Content and Acceptable Use.

You may also request for your account to be deleted; by requesting such deletion, you understand that account deletion may be permanent and irreversible. You also understand that the content you have provided to the Service under your account could be retained, despite your account deletion, as stated in User Content and Creative Commons Licensing.

## Intellectual Property

For suspected intellectual property rights infringements in submitted user content, you may use the content reporting functionality that may be provided by {{ service_name }}; should such functionality be unavailable, you may contact the Service operator(s) by other means possible.

The source code of the Service website and software, if provided, should come with a license in the code repository or archive. This may or may not be the *BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License*; the repository or archive should contain the definitive license.

## Privacy Policy

**What data we collect and how**

The only personally identifiable data that the Service intentionally collects are the basic account information requested at the time of account creation: your username, email address, and password. (As is standard website security practice, the Service stores only a cryptographic hash of your password.)

*Content that you submit to the Service is not considered personal data, although it is linked to your account by default. Certain types of user content on the Service, such as notes, are always publicly accessible; this is true even if the user employs ‘unlisting’ functionality, if such is available. The Service is not intended for sensitive or private data storage or communications.*

The Service also collects non-sensitive account metadata such as the date and timestamps of account creation and last account login, which are not displayed publicly by default.

Systems used to run the Service, some of which are operated by third-party service providers, may collect standard technical data/metadata such as your IP address and the name and version of your browser application. This data may be stored automatically and temporarily in server and application logs.

**Cookies**

The Service uses only strictly necessary cookies for security and to provide requested functionality; no personally-identifying third-party cookies or trackers are intentionally served by {{ service_name }}. This is why the Service does not present a “cookie banner”.

If you find that, in the course of using the Service, privacy-violating cookies are being set on your device, you may report it to the Service operator(s) after making an attempt to ascertain that such cookies are not being delivered by any hardware, software, or network configurations outside of the control of the Service.

**Why we collect the data and how it will be used**

The data is only used to provide and manage the Service, and to enable communications with you regarding your account and your use of the Service.

Your *personal* data is not used for profit. Your user content, due to the Creative Commons license, may be used commercially by the Service or other users of the Service.

**How long we retain your data**

Your personal data is retained for as long as your account exists on the Service. You may request to have your account deleted at any time.

**How we protect your data**

{{ service_name }} strives to employ the best measures in securing the data in the Service. These include best practices in software development & maintenance and system administration.

Users and other interested parties are welcome to suggest improvements for the security of the Service’s technology stack and deployment, although {{ service_name }} is not obligated to implement such suggestions, especially if it deems the suggestions inappropriate for the Service’s threat model.

**Whom we share your data with**

{{ service_name }} only shares your data to trusted service providers who merely act in an *information processor* capacity necessary to operate the Service. These entities include computing infrastructure providers and network security companies.

Your personal data is not sold or traded or otherwise shared to be exploited for profit.

**Your rights and how you can exercise them**

{{ service_name }} honors your rights as a data subject under any applicable data privacy law. The Service may already have many self-service functionalities available for exercising these rights, such as facilities for unlinking your account from content.

For any inquiries or requests, you may use any support functionality available in the Service or otherwise contact the Service operator(s) by any means possible.

## Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Warranties

To the fullest extent possible under applicable law, the operator(s) of {{ service_name }} or its suppliers (service providers) will not be held accountable for any damages that may be caused by the use of, or inability to use, the Service, even if they or their representatives have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

The Service is provided “as is”. Its operator(s) disclaims any warranties, whether expressed or implied.

## Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of {{ governing_country }}. With respect to these Terms, and except if prohibited under applicable law, the parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of {{ governing_country }}.

## Changes to These Terms of Service and Privacy Policy

{{ service_name }} reserves the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time.

If the changes are substantial, reasonable efforts to provide prior notice will be made. Such notices might be provided through email; it is your responsibility to keep your account email address updated, and to regularly check your spam folder in case your email service provider incorrectly marks the Service’s emails as spam. {{ service_name }} reserves the right to determine what constitutes substantial changes to these Terms.

By continuing to use the Service, you agree to be bound by the current effective version of these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
